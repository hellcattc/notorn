# **Notorn** 

## Notorn is meant as a self-hostable messenger app.
### It uses PSQL & Redis under the hood. ~~I will containerize it with Docker, or create an image, in near future.~~ 

### You need to generate RSA-256 paired keys and add them to .env file. I will add automatic generation of these to container in near future.
